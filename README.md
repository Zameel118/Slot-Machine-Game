## Code Structure

- `deposit()`: Handles initial money deposit with input validation
- `num_of_lines()`: Gets user's choice of betting lines (1-3)
- `get_bet()`: Gets bet amount with validation ($1-$100)
- `get_slot_machine_spin()`: Generates random slot machine results
- `print_slot_machine()`: Displays the slot machine grid
- `check_winnings()`: Calculates winnings and identifies winning lines
- `spin()`: Main game logic for a single spin
- `main()`: Game loop and balance management

## Configuration

You can easily modify the game settings by changing these constants in `main.py`:

```python
MAX_LINES = 3      # Maximum betting lines
MAX_BET = 100      # Maximum bet per line
MIN_BET = 1        # Minimum bet per line
ROWS = 3           # Slot machine rows
COLS = 3           # Slot machine columns
```

### Symbol Configuration
Modify `symbol_count` to change symbol frequency:
```python
symbol_count = {
    "A": 2,  # 2 A's in the symbol pool
    "B": 4,  # 4 B's in the symbol pool
    "C": 6,  # 6 C's in the symbol pool
    "D": 8   # 8 D's in the symbol pool
}
```

Modify `symbol_value` to change payout multipliers:
```python
symbol_value = {
    "A": 5,  # 5x multiplier for A
    "B": 4,  # 4x multiplier for B
    "C": 3,  # 3x multiplier for C
    "D": 2   # 2x multiplier for D
}
```
